-- The sales department has given you the sales figures for the first two months of 2023. 
-- You've been tasked with determining the percentage of weekly sales on the first and last
-- day of every week. Consider Sunday as last day of week and Monday as first day of week.
-- In your output, include the week number, percentage sales for the first day of the week, 
-- and percentage sales for the last day of the week. Both proportions should be rounded to 
-- the nearest whole number.
