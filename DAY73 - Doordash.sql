-- ùêåùêÆùê¨ùê≠ ùêìùê´ùê≤: DoorDash(Hard Level) #SQL Interview Question ‚Äî Solution
-- You have been asked to investigate whether there is a correlation between the average 
-- total order value and the average time in minutes between placing an order and having 
-- it delivered per restaurant. You have also been told that the column order_total 
-- represents the gross order total for each order. Therefore, you'll need to calculate 
-- the net order total. The gross order total is the total of the order before adding the 
-- tip and deducting the discount and refund. Make sure correlation is rounded to 2 decimals.

-- Database setup:
