-- A table named ‚Äúfamous‚Äù has two columns called user id and follower id. 
-- It represents each user ID has a particular follower ID.
-- These follower IDs are also users of Meta. Then, find the famous percentage of each user. 
-- Famous Percentage = number of followers a user has / total number of users on the platform.

-- Database setup:
CREATE TABLE FAMOUS (USER_ID INT, FOLLOWER_ID INT);
INSERT INTO
	FAMOUS
VALUES
	(1, 2),
	(1, 3),
	(2, 4),
