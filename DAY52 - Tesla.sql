-- The company you are working for wants to anticipate their staffing needs by identifying
-- their top two busiest times of the week. To find this, each day should be segmented into 
-- differents parts using following criteria:
-- 1. Morning: Before 12 p.m. (not inclusive)
-- 2. Early afternoon: 12 - 15 p.m.
-- 3. Late afternoon: after 15 p.m. (not inclusive)

-- Your output should include the day and time of day combination for the two busiest times, 
-- i.e. the combinations with the most orders, along with the number of orders (e.g. top two 
-- results could be Friday Late afternoon with 12 orders and Sunday Morning with 10 orders). 
-- The company has also requested that the day be displayed in text format (i.e. Monday).
-- Note: In the event of a tie in ranking, all results should be displayed.\
