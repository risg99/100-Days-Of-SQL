-- You have a table of in-app purchases by user. Users that make their first in-app purchase
-- are placed in a marketing campaign where they see call-to-actions for more in-app purchases.
-- Find the number of users that made additional in-app purchases due to the success of the 
-- marketing campaign. The marketing campaign doesn't start until one day after the initial
-- in-app purchase so users that only made one or multiple purchases on the first day do not
-- count, nor do we count users that over time purchase only the products they purchased on
-- the first day.

-- Database setup:

	CREATED_AT TIMESTAMP,
