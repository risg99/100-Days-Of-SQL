-- Find the average absolute fare difference between a specific passenger and all 
-- passengers that belong to the same pclass, both are non-survivors and age difference
-- between two of them is 5 or less years. Do that for each passenger (that satisfy
-- above mentioned coniditions). Output the result along with the passenger name.
