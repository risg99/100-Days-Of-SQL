-- ùêåùêÆùê¨ùê≠ ùêìùê´ùê≤: Meta (Hard Level) #SQL Interview Question ‚Äî Solution
-- Write a query to calculate the distribution of comments by the count of users that 
-- joined Meta/Facebook between 2018 and 2020, for the month of January 2020.
-- The output should contain a count of comments and the corresponding number of users 
-- that made that number of comments in Jan-2020. For example, you'll be counting how 
-- many users made 1 comment, 2 comments, 3 comments, 4 comments, etc in Jan-2020. 
-- Your left column in the output will be the number of comments while your right column
-- in the output will be the number of users. Sort the output from the least number of 
-- comments to highest.
-- To add some complexity, there might be a bug where an user post is dated before the user 
-- join date. You'll want to remove these posts from the result.
