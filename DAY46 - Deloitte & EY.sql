-- In a marathon, gun time is counted from the moment of the formal start of the race while
-- net time is counted from the moment a runner crosses a starting line. Both variables are in seconds.
-- You are asked to check if the interval between the two times is different for male and female runners. 
-- First, calculate the average absolute difference between the gun time and net time. Group the results
-- by available genders (male and female). Output the absolute difference between those two values.

-- Database setup:
