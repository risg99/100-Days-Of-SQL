-- You are given a table of tennis players and their matches that they could 
-- either win (W) or lose (L). Find the longest streak of wins. A streak is a 
-- set of consecutive won matches of one player. The streak ends once a player
-- loses their next match. Output the ID of the player or players and the length 
-- of the streak.

-- Database setup:
CREATE TABLE PLAYERS_RESULTS (
	MATCH_DATE DATE,
	MATCH_RESULT VARCHAR(1),
	PLAYER_ID BIGINT
);

INSERT INTO
	PLAYERS_RESULTS (MATCH_DATE, MATCH_RESULT, PLAYER_ID)
VALUES
	('2023-01-01', 'W', 1),
	('2023-01-02', 'W', 1),
	('2023-01-03', 'L', 1),
	('2023-01-04', 'W', 1),
	('2023-01-01', 'L', 2),
	('2023-01-02', 'W', 2),
	('2023-01-03', 'W', 2),
	('2023-01-04', 'W', 2),
